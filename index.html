<h1>Adjacent Reality</h1>
<p>Adjacent Reality is a riff on Stuart Kauffman's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html">adjacent possible</a>.  We formed it to explore and make possible the realities slightly adjacent to our own, primarily through hacks and inventions that bridge the virtual and the real.</p>

<p>In more grounded terms, we are building open source human computer interaction hardware and writing nifty software to go with it.  Our first project is Tracker, a tiny, inexpensive, wirelessly interfaced inertial measurement unit, or motion/orientation tracker.  The primary use case is virtual reality, but we are sure you can think of other fun ways to use it.  We'll have more friendly documentation as the project gets closer to complete, but in the mean time, you can follow our progress on GitHub.</p>

</ul>
<p>We finished revision 2 of Tracker in May 2012, but we weren't satisfied with the size, power consumption, or latency of Bluetooth.  We're currently spinning (get it?) a third revision of the board with a target size of 1" in diameter, power draw of under 20mA, and latency of under 10ms.  When we think the Tracker is good enough, we're planning on building a few hundred of them and selling them to anyone interested.  The target price is $50.  If you're interested, you can put your email address in the form below.  We'll send out one and only one email, hopefully this Fall, letting you know that the Tracker is up for preordering.  You could also follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/AdjacentReality">@AdjacentReality</a>.  If you aren't the patient type, everything is open source, so you are welcome to build one along with us.</p>
