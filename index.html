<h1>Adjacent Reality</h1>
<p>Adjacent Reality is a riff on Stuart Kauffman's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html">adjacent possible</a>.  We formed it to explore and make possible the realities slightly adjacent to our own, primarily through hacks and inventions that bridge the virtual and the real.</p>

<p>In more grounded terms, we are building open source human computer interaction hardware and writing nifty software to go with it.  Our first project is Tracker, a tiny, inexpensive, wirelessly interfaced inertial measurement unit, or motion/orientation tracker.  We'll have more friendly documentation as the project gets closer to complete, but in the mean time, you can follow our progress on GitHub.</p>

<p>This site is a placeholder, as all of my spare time is going into building the Tracker.  Feel free to email me if you are curious about Tracker or Adjacent Reality.</p>
